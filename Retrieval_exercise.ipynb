It may also refer to a society or group of people that entirely rejects a set hierarchy.\\n\\nIn practical terms, anarchy can refer to the curtailment or abolition of traditional forms of government and institutions. It can also designate a nation or any inhabited place that has no system of government or central rule. Anarchy is primarily advocated by individual anarchists who propose replacing government with voluntary institutions. These institutions or free associations are generally modeled on nature since they can represent concepts such as community and economic self-reliance, interdependence, or individualism. Although anarchy is often negatively used as a synonym of chaos or societal collapse or anomie, this is not the meaning that anarchists attribute to anarchy, a society without hierarchies.\\n\\nEtymology[edit] Anarchy comes from the Latin word anarchia, which came from the Greek word anarchos (\"having no ruler\"), with an- (\"not\" or \"without\") + archos (\"ruler\") literally meaning \"without [a] ruler\".[1] Anarchy was first used in English in 1539, meaning \"an absence of government\".[1]', metadata={'source': '/home/jupyter/MLSysDes/data/anarchy.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Systems theory is the interdisciplinary study of systems, i.e. cohesive groups of interrelated, interdependent components that can be natural or human-made. Every system has causal boundaries, is influenced by its context, defined by its structure, function and role, and expressed through its relations with other systems. A system is \"more than the sum of its parts\" by expressing synergy or emergent behavior.[1]\\n\\nChanging one component of a system may affect other components or the whole system. It may be possible to predict these changes in patterns of behavior. For systems that learn and adapt, the growth and the degree of adaptation depend upon how well the system is engaged with its environment and other contexts influencing its organization. Some systems support other systems, maintaining the other system to prevent failure. The goals of systems theory are to model a system\\'s dynamics, constraints, conditions, and relations; and to elucidate principles (such as purpose, measure, methods, tools) that can be discerned and applied to other systems at every level of nesting, and in a wide range of fields for achieving optimized equifinality.[2]\\n\\nGeneral systems theory is about developing broadly applicable concepts and principles, as opposed to concepts and principles specific to one domain of knowledge. It distinguishes dynamic or active systems from static or passive systems. Active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes or interrelate through formal contextual boundary conditions (attractors). Passive systems are structures and components that are being processed. For example, a program is passive when it is a disc file and active when it runs in memory.[3] The field is related to systems thinking, machine logic, and systems engineering.', metadata={'source': '/home/jupyter/MLSysDes/data/Systems theory.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology and social outlook that emphasizes the intrinsic worth of the individual.[1][2] Individualists promote the realisation of one\\'s goals and desires, valuing independence and self-reliance, and advocating that the interests of the individual should gain precedence over the state or a social group, while opposing external interference upon one\\'s own interests by society or institutions such as the government.[3] Individualism is often defined in contrast to totalitarianism, collectivism and more corporate social forms.[4][5]\\n\\nIndividualism makes the individual its focus[1] and so starts \"with the fundamental premise that the human individual is of primary importance in the struggle for liberation\".[6]\\n\\nIndividualism has been used as a term denoting \"[t]he quality of being an individual; individuality\", related to possessing \"[a]n individual characteristic; a quirk\".[3] Individualism is also associated with artistic and bohemian interests and lifestyles where there is a tendency towards self-creation and experimentation as opposed to tradition or popular mass opinions and behaviors[3][7] such as with humanist philosophical positions and ethics.[8][9]\\n\\nEtymology[edit] In the English language, the word individualism was first introduced as a pejorative by utopian socialists such as the Owenites in the late 1830s, although it is unclear if they were influenced by Saint-Simonianism or came up with it independently.[10] A more positive use of the term in Britain came to be used with the writings of James Elishama Smith, who was a millenarian and a Christian Israelite. Although an early follower of Robert Owen, he eventually rejected Owen\\'s collective idea of property and found in individualism a \"universalism\" that allowed for the development of the \"original genius\". Without individualism, Smith argued that individuals cannot amass property to increase one\\'s happiness.[10] William Maccall, another Unitarian preacher and probably an acquaintance of Smith, came somewhat later, although influenced by John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle and German Romanticism, to the same positive conclusions in his 1847 work Elements of Individualism.[11]\\n\\nIndividual[edit] Main article: Individual An individual is a person or any specific object in a collection. In the 15th century and earlier, and also today within the fields of statistics and metaphysics, individual means \"indivisible\", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning \"a person\" as in \"the problem of proper names\". From the 17th century on, individual indicates separateness, as in individualism.[12] Individuality is the state or quality of being an individuated being; a person separated from everything with unique character by possessing their own needs, goals, and desires in comparison to other persons.[13]\\n\\nIndividuation principle[edit] Main article: Individuation The principle of individuation, or principium individuationis,[14] describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.[15] For Carl Jung, individuation is a process of transformation, whereby the personal and collective unconscious is brought into consciousness (by means of dreams, active imagination or free association to take examples) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche to take place.[16] Jung considered individuation to be the central process of human development.[17] In L\\'individuation psychique et collective, Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending ontological process of individuation. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a \"pre-individual\" left-over, itself making possible future individuations.[18] The philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of Gilbert Simondon on individuation and also upon similar ideas in Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. For Stiegler, \"the I, as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to we, which is a collective individual. The I is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of I\\'s acknowledge each other\\'s existence.\"[19]\\n\\nIndividualism and society[edit] Individualism holds that a person taking part in society attempts to learn and discover what his or her own interests are on a personal basis, without a presumed following of the interests of a societal structure (an individualist need not be an egoist). The individualist does not necessarily follow one particular philosophy. He may create an amalgamation of elements of many philosophies, based on personal interests in particular aspects that he finds of use. On a societal level, the individualist participates on a personally structured political and moral ground. Independent thinking and opinion is a necessary trait of an individualist. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, claims that his concept of general will in The Social Contract is not the simple collection of individual wills and that it furthers the interests of the individual (the constraint of law itself would be beneficial for the individual, as the lack of respect for the law necessarily entails, in Rousseau\\'s eyes, a form of ignorance and submission to one\\'s passions instead of the preferred autonomy of reason).\\n\\nIndividualism versus collectivism is a common dichotomy in cross-cultural research. Global comparative studies have found that the world\\'s cultures vary in the degree to which they emphasize individual autonomy, freedom and initiative (individualistic traits), respectively conformity to group norms, maintaining traditions and obedience to in-group authority (collectivistic traits).[20] Cultural differences between individualism and collectivism are differences in degrees, not in kind.[21] Cultural individualism is strongly correlated with GDP per capita.[22] The cultures of economically developed regions such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea,[23][24][25] North America and Western Europe are the most individualistic in the world. Middle income regions such as Eastern Europe, South America and mainland East Asia have cultures which are neither very individualistic nor very collectivistic. The most collectivistic cultures in the world are from economically developing regions such as the Middle East and Northern Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, South and South-East Asia, Central Asia and Central America.[26][27][28]\\n\\nAn earlier analysis by Ruth Benedict in her book The Chrysanthemum and the Sword states that societies and groups can differ in the extent to which they are based upon predominantly \"self-regarding\" (individualistic, and/or self-interested) behaviors, rather than \"other-regarding\" (group-oriented, and group, or society-minded) behaviors. Ruth Benedict made a distinction, relevant in this context, between guilt societies (e.g. medieval Europe) with an \"internal reference standard\" and shame societies (e.g. Japan, \"bringing shame upon one\\'s ancestors\") with an \"external reference standard\", where people look to their peers for feedback on whether an action is acceptable or not.[29]\\n\\nIndividualism is often contrasted either with totalitarianism or with collectivism,[5] but there is a spectrum of behaviors at the societal level ranging from highly individualistic societies through mixed societies to collectivist.[30][31]\\n\\nCompetitive individualism[edit] According to an Oxford Dictionary, \"competitive individualism\" in sociology is \"the view that achievement and non-achievement should depend on merit. Effort and ability are regarded as prerequisites of success. Competition is seen as an acceptable means of distributing limited resources and rewards.\\n\\nMethodological individualism[edit] Methodological individualism is the view that phenomena can only be understood by examining how they result from the motivations and actions of individual agents.[32] In economics, people\\'s behavior is explained in terms of rational choices, as constrained by prices and incomes. The economist accepts individuals\\' preferences as givens. Becker and Stigler provide a forceful statement of this view:\\n\\nOn the traditional view, an explanation of economic phenomena that reaches a difference in tastes between people or times is the terminus of the argument: the problem is abandoned at this point to whoever studies and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists? sociobiologists?). On our preferred interpretation, one never reaches this impasse: the economist continues to search for differences in prices or incomes to explain any differences or changes in behavior.[33]', metadata={'source': '/home/jupyter/MLSysDes/data/Individualism.txt'})]"
